## Summary

QA Engineer specializing in building and scaling advanced test automation solutions across multiple platforms — including desktop (Electron), web (desktop & mobile), and native mobile applications. I design and implement reliable frameworks from scratch using Playwright, WebdriverIO, and Cypress for E2E, API, and integration testing.

My role extends beyond testing — I drive test architecture decisions, optimize CI/CD pipelines, and mentor teams to achieve higher quality standards. I actively leverage AI tools to boost efficiency and explore innovative testing approaches. My goal is to ensure stable, high-quality product delivery that directly supports business success.
