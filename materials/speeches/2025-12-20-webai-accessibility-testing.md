# WebAI in Action: AI-Powered Accessibility Testing in Chrome

## Coming Soon

This session will be presented at DevFest Armenia 2025 on December 20, 2025.

## Event

[DevFest Armenia 2025](https://devfest.am/2025)

## Location

Yerevan, Armenia

## Abstract

Chrome's built-in WebAI provides access to Gemini, a multimodal AI model that can analyze text, images, and web page structures directly in the browser. In this session, I'll show how a QA engineer can use it to build a working Chrome extension for accessibility testing.

The tool combines visual and DOM analysis to detect accessibility issues and generate actionable recommendations — from color contrast improvements to labeling corrections — all running locally in Chrome using Gemini.

## Key Topics

- Chrome WebAI and Gemini integration
- Building Chrome extensions for accessibility testing
- Visual and DOM analysis for accessibility issues
- Local AI processing in the browser
- Actionable accessibility recommendations

## Workshop Materials

For the workshop, you can find the extension here: [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Andrey-Roshchupkin/chrome-web-ai-a11y-testing-extension)

**Note:** The Gemini Nano model in Chrome and the Gemma model in Ollama will take some time to download, so it might be better to do this at home.
