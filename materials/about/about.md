# About Me

I'm a father, runner, and QA engineer who believes that the best work comes from a balanced life.

## Family First

I have a son, and spending quality time with him is what matters most. We love being active together and building adventures in Minecraft — it's amazing to see the world through his eyes and create something together.

## Running & Community

I'm passionate about running and regularly train for distances up to half-marathon. But running isn't just about personal achievement for me — I lead a running group for beginners, helping others discover the joy and benefits of running. There's something special about seeing someone complete their first 5K or achieve a goal they never thought possible.

## Learning & Growth

I'm always learning something new. Currently, I'm teaching myself to play the guitar, exploring new songs and techniques. I believe that learning outside of work — whether it's music, running, or anything else — keeps me curious and brings fresh perspectives to everything I do.

## Work

I'm a QA Automation Engineer / SDET, building test automation frameworks and exploring how AI can enhance testing. The balance with family, running, music, and learning keeps me grounded and brings fresh perspectives to my work.
